Error Boundaries in React are a way to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

Here's an example of how you can use Error Boundaries:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    console.log(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}

// Usage
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

In this example, `ErrorBoundary` is a component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. `getDerivedStateFromError` is a lifecycle method that catches errors during the "render" phase. `componentDidCatch` catches errors during the "commit" phase.

Remember, error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree. An error boundary canâ€™t catch an error within itself. 
Happy coding! ðŸš€
