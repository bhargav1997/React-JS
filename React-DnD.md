Integrating React DnD into your React project allows you to add drag-and-drop functionality with ease. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Installation**
   First, you need to install React DnD and its HTML5 backend. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
   ```

2. **Setup**
   Import the necessary modules from `react-dnd` and `react-dnd-html5-backend` in your component file.

3. **Drag Source**
   Define a component as a drag source by using the `DragSource` higher-order component (HOC) from React DnD. You'll need to specify the type of item being dragged and collect the necessary props.

4. **Drop Target**
   Similarly, use the `DropTarget` HOC to define where items can be dropped. You'll need to define the drop behavior and how the drop affects the state of your app.

5. **Implement Drag and Drop**
   Implement the drag-and-drop functionality by connecting your drag sources and drop targets with the DnD context.

6. **Customize Drag Previews**
   Customize the appearance of the drag preview by providing a rendering function.

Here's a basic example of a drag source and drop target in React DnD:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { DragSource, DropTarget } from 'react-dnd';

// Define the drag source contract
const cardSource = {
  beginDrag(props) {
    return {
      id: props.id,
      text: props.text,
    };
  },
};

// Define the drop target contract
const cardTarget = {
  drop(props, monitor) {
    if (monitor.didDrop()) {
      return;
    }
    props.onDrop(monitor.getItem());
  },
};

// Your component
class Card extends React.Component {
  // Your component code
}

// Apply the HOCs
export default DropTarget('CARD', cardTarget, (connect) => ({
  connectDropTarget: connect.dropTarget(),
}))(
  DragSource('CARD', cardSource, (connect, monitor) => ({
    connectDragSource: connect.dragSource(),
    isDragging: monitor.isDragging(),
  }))(Card)
);
```

This example shows a simple card component that can be dragged and dropped. The `beginDrag` method in the drag source specifies what data is being dragged, and the `drop` method in the drop target specifies what happens when an item is dropped.
