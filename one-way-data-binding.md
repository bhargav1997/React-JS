In React, **one-way data binding** refers to the flow of data in a single direction, from the parent component down to the child components. This means that when the state of the parent component changes, the child components are updated, but not vice versa. 

This is different from two-way data binding, where changes in the child components can also update the state of the parent component. Two-way data binding is common in frameworks like AngularJS.

In React, one-way data binding is implemented through the use of `props` and `state`. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { message: 'Hello, World!' };
  }

  render() {
    return <ChildComponent message={this.state.message} />;
  }
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <h1>{props.message}</h1>;
}
```

In this example, the `ParentComponent` passes its state (the `message`) down to the `ChildComponent` via props. If the state in the `ParentComponent` changes, the `ChildComponent` will be re-rendered with the new `message`. However, the `ChildComponent` cannot directly change the `message` in the `ParentComponent`'s state. This is the essence of one-way data binding in React.

This one-way data flow makes it easier to understand how data changes in an application, making it easier to debug and maintain. It also helps prevent a variety of bugs that can occur from cyclical dependencies and other issues associated with two-way data binding.
