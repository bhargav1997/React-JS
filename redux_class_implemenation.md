Let's dive into Redux implementation step by step in a React application with a proper example and explanation.

**Step 1: Setting up Redux**

First, you need to install Redux and React-Redux packages in your React project:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux
```

**Step 2: Creating Redux Store**

In your project, create a new file called `store.js` where you'll define your Redux store. This is where all your application's states will be managed.

```javascript
// store.js

import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // We'll create this later

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```

**Step 3: Creating Reducers**

Reducers are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Let's create a simple reducer for managing a counter:

```javascript
// reducers.js

const initialState = {
  count: 0
};

const rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return {
        ...state,
        count: state.count + 1
      };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return {
        ...state,
        count: state.count - 1
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default rootReducer;
```

**Step 4: Creating Actions**

Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Redux store. Let's define actions for incrementing and decrementing the counter:

```javascript
// actions.js

export const increment = () => ({
  type: 'INCREMENT'
});

export const decrement = () => ({
  type: 'DECREMENT'
});
```

**Step 5: Connecting Redux to React**

Now, let's connect Redux to your React components using `react-redux` library. 

```javascript
// App.js

import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import Counter from './Counter'; // Assume you have a component named Counter

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <div className="App">
        <Counter />
      </div>
    </Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Step 6: Creating Components**

Now, let's create a component called `Counter.js` where we'll interact with Redux store:

```javascript
// Counter.js

import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from './actions';

const Counter = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  count: state.count
});

const mapDispatchToProps = {
  increment,
  decrement
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

**Step 7: Explaining the Code**

- In `Counter.js`, we connect the `Counter` component to Redux store using the `connect` function from `react-redux`.
- `mapStateToProps` function maps the state from Redux store to the component's props. Here, we're mapping the `count` state to the prop `count`.
- `mapDispatchToProps` object maps action creators to the component's props. Here, we're mapping `increment` and `decrement` actions to props.
- Inside the `Counter` component, we can access the `count` state and `increment` and `decrement` actions directly from props.

**Step 8: Using Redux in Components**

Now, you can use the `Counter` component in your application, and it will interact with the Redux store. Whenever you click the "Increment" or "Decrement" buttons, the corresponding actions will be dispatched to the Redux store, updating the state accordingly.

That's it! You've successfully implemented Redux in a React application. Keep practicing, and you'll become more comfortable with Redux over time!
