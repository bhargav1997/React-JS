Web accessibility is crucial for making the web usable by everyone. Here are some guidelines and their corresponding code implementations in React:

1. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure that your website is fully usable via keyboard. This is important for users who rely on keyboards or keyboard-like inputs.

    ```jsx
    // Good: The button is accessible by keyboard
    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</button>
    ```

2. **Image Alt Text**: Always provide alternative text for images which describes the content of the image. This helps screen readers interpret the image content.

    ```jsx
    // Good: The image has alt text
    <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" />
    ```

3. **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML elements as they provide inherent accessibility benefits. For custom components, use ARIA roles to provide semantic information.

    ```jsx
    // Good: Semantic HTML and ARIA roles
    <header role="banner">...</header>
    <nav role="navigation">...</nav>
    <main role="main">...</main>
    <footer role="contentinfo">...</footer>
    ```

4. **Accessible Forms**: Label all form elements properly. This helps screen readers announce what each field is for.

    ```jsx
    // Good: The input field is properly labeled
    <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
    <input id="name" type="text" name="name"/>
    ```

5. **Color and Contrast**: Ensure that text color contrasts sufficiently with the background color. This is important for users with low vision.

    ```jsx
    // Ensure sufficient contrast between background and text
    <div style={{ color: 'white', backgroundColor: 'black' }}>Hello, World!</div>
    ```

6. **Dynamic Content Updates**: When content updates dynamically (e.g., in a single-page app), ensure that screen readers can understand the changes.

    ```jsx
    // React automatically handles updates and focus management when using state and props
    this.setState({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
    ```

7. **Skip Links**: Provide "skip to content" links at the top of your page to allow keyboard users to skip repetitive content.

    ```jsx
    // Good: A skip link
    <a href="#maincontent">Skip to main content</a>
    <div id="maincontent">This is the main content.</div>
    ```

Remember, accessibility is not just a set of rules to follow. 
It's about ensuring an inclusive and equal experience for all users.
